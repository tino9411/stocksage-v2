Instructions for Offline Authorization
--------------------------------------

To authorize Live offline you will need:

- A USB stick or external hard drive

- A different computer that has an internet connection

- Your Ableton serial number (if it hasnâ€™t been registered to your ableton.com account yet)

- Your hardware code: 223E-8B9C-20F1-63D3-F600-C769

Go to this page on a separate internet-connected computer to download an authorization file from your account: https://www.ableton.com/account/authorize/offline/ 

You can then move that file to your offline computer using a USB stick or external hard drive. Launch the version of Live you want to authorize and then open the file to complete the authorization.
